# Playing with time

This repo is for playing with OOP concepts in Python while also creating small programs with time-related
functionality (timers, pomodoros, etc.)


## TODO
- Add exception-handling.
- Add my own audio files for better alerts.
- Create interval timer functionality.
  - Allow the user to specify intervals and sub-intervals (e.g. pomodoro)
  - Play notifications to indicate the start/end of each interval (use different sounds for start and end).
  - Allow option for random intervals (e.g. on average, once every two minutes, start a ten-second interval).
- Implement a micro-interval timer to facilitate neuroplasticity (Andrew Huberman podcast).
